I am a full-stack software engineer especially interested in building magical mobile experiences, scaling systems up, and shipping reliable applications. Note: use the summary when it makes sense.

<!-- Coursework is generally not a great use of space on a resume. If you feel strongly about including it, only include upper-level courses that are interesting / important. Do not include intro-level courses.

ie: Data structures and Algorithms, AI / ML, Server side web development, etc.
